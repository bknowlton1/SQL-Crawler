A quick python script to sift through SQL files in a directory of your
choosing looking for a specific key word. If that key word is found in the
contents of the SQL file, you will be able to view the SQL code in the
command prompt to validate it is in fact what you are looking for.  

Tested and developed on and for Windows machines.
